# One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers.
# When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
# Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number,
# and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text
# instead of a number.
